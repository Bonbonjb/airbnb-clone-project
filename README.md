# Airbnb Clone Project

##  Overview
This project is a backend implementation of an Airbnb-like application. The goal is to replicate the core functionality of Airbnb — including user registration, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews — using modern web development technologies. The backend is designed to be scalable, efficient, and secure.

##  Project Goals
* Build secure user authentication and profile management.
* Enable creation, retrieval, and management of property listings.
* Implement a full-featured booking system.
* Integrate payment processing for secure transactions.
* Allow users to post and manage reviews for properties.
* Optimize data access and storage for performance and scalability.

##  Technology Stack
* **Django** – High-level Python web framework for developing RESTful APIs.
* **Django REST Framework** – Extension to Django for building Web APIs.
* **PostgreSQL** – Robust relational database for structured data storage.
* **GraphQL** – Flexible query language for interacting with APIs.
* **Celery** – Handles asynchronous tasks like sending emails or notifications.
* **Redis** – In-memory store used for caching and session management.
* **Docker** git add README.md
* **CI/CD Pipelines** – Automate testing, building, and deployment (e.g., GitHub Actions).

##  Technology stack

 This project employs a current web development stack to create a scalable, maintainable, and durable platform.


 ### *Django* 
* Django is a high-level Python web framework used for application backend development.  
* It enables rapid development, has a clean architecture, and contains an ORM for database interaction.

 ### *PostgreSQL* 
* A robust open-source relational database system. 
* Used to store and manage structured data such as user profiles, bookings, and property information.

 ### *GraphQL*
* This is a query language for APIs that enables customers to request specific data. 
* In comparison to REST APIs, it allows for more efficient data fetching and reduces over-fetching.

### *Docker*
* This is a containerization platform packages and deploys applications in isolated environments. 
*  Maintains consistency across the development, testing, and production environments.


### *GitHub Actions*  
* This CI/CD solution integrates with GitHub to automate testing and deployment operations.  
* Helps to maintain code quality and streamline the delivery process.

### *React (Optional Frontend Integration)* 
* This is a JavaScript library for creating quick and responsive user interfaces.  
* Can be used to build dynamic and interactive client-side components.

### *Nginx*
* This is a web server that can serve static files and function as a reverse proxy. 
* Used for load balancing, caching, and improving application speed.

 ### *Gunicorn* 
* This is a Python WSGI HTTP server for UNIX platforms.  
* Works with Django to run the backend application in production.
