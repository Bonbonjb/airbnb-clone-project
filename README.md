# Airbnb Clone Project

##  Overview
This project is a backend implementation of an Airbnb-like application. The goal is to replicate the core functionality of Airbnb — including user registration, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews — using modern web development technologies. The backend is designed to be scalable, efficient, and secure.

##  Project Goals
* Build secure user authentication and profile management.
* Enable creation, retrieval, and management of property listings.
* Implement a full-featured booking system.
* Integrate payment processing for secure transactions.
* Allow users to post and manage reviews for properties.
* Optimize data access and storage for performance and scalability.

##  Technology Stack
* **Django** – High-level Python web framework for developing RESTful APIs.
* **Django REST Framework** – Extension to Django for building Web APIs.
* **PostgreSQL** – Robust relational database for structured data storage.
* **GraphQL** – Flexible query language for interacting with APIs.
* **Celery** – Handles asynchronous tasks like sending emails or notifications.
* **Redis** – In-memory store used for caching and session management.
* **Docker** git add README.md
* **CI/CD Pipelines** – Automate testing, building, and deployment (e.g., GitHub Actions).

##  Technology stack

 This project employs a current web development stack to create a scalable, maintainable, and durable platform.


### *Django* 
* Django is a high-level Python web framework used for application backend development.  
* It enables rapid development, has a clean architecture, and contains an ORM for database interaction.

### *Django REST Framework (DRF)*
* Is a powerful and flexible toolkit built on top of Django for building Web APIs.
* Simplifies the process of building and consuming APIs.

### *PostgreSQL* 
* A robust open-source relational database system. 
* Used to store and manage structured data such as user profiles, bookings, and property information.

### *GraphQL*
* This is a query language for APIs that enables customers to request specific data. 
* In comparison to REST APIs, it allows for more efficient data fetching and reduces over-fetching.

### *Celery*
* A distributed task queue for handling asynchronous operations.
* Manages background tasks such as sending emails, processing payments, and generating reports.

### *Redis*
* An in-memory data store used as a database, cache, and message broker.
* Supports fast access to frequently used data and helps with task queue management (via Celery).

### *Docker*
* This is a containerization platform packages and deploys applications in isolated environments. 
*  Maintains consistency across the development, testing, and production environments.


### *CI/CD Pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions)*
* This CI/CD solution integrates with GitHub to automate testing, building and deployment operations.  
* Ensures code quality and reduces manual errors through continuous integration and delivery workflows.
