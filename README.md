# Airbnb Clone Project

##  Overview
This project is a backend implementation of an Airbnb-like application. The goal is to replicate the core functionality of Airbnb — including user registration, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews — using modern web development technologies. The backend is designed to be scalable, efficient, and secure.

##  Project Goals
* Build secure user authentication and profile management.
* Enable creation, retrieval, and management of property listings.
* Implement a full-featured booking system.
* Integrate payment processing for secure transactions.
* Allow users to post and manage reviews for properties.
* Optimize data access and storage for performance and scalability.

##  Technology Stack
* **Django** – High-level Python web framework for developing RESTful APIs.
* **Django REST Framework** – Extension to Django for building Web APIs.
* **PostgreSQL** – Robust relational database for structured data storage.
* **GraphQL** – Flexible query language for interacting with APIs.
* **Celery** – Handles asynchronous tasks like sending emails or notifications.
* **Redis** – In-memory store used for caching and session management.
* **Docker** git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: update project overview and tech stack in README"
git push origin main– Containerization for consistent development and deployment.
* **CI/CD Pipelines** – Automate testing, building, and deployment (e.g., GitHub Actions).
